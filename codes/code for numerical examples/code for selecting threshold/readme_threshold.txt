The R scripts in this folder implement how to determine the threshold in the Table 1, block 4* of "Integrative Clustering Analysis with Application in Multi-Source Gene Expression Data".

prep: estimate the parameters.
1,2,3,4: R code to determine thresholds for p.noise.X=0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4 (need parallel computing)
plot_table: summarize the reulst (one can directly run it to produce the table and plots)
